# ISO 19795 (Biometric Performance Testing)

## Definition

**ISO/IEC 19795** defines the methodology for testing and reporting the performance of biometric systems — establishing standardized testing protocols so that performance claims are comparable and reproducible.

## Key Parts

| Part | Title | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| **19795-1** | Principles and framework | General testing methodology, experimental design |
| **19795-2** | Testing methodologies for technology and scenario evaluation | Lab and scenario-based testing |
| **19795-4** | Interoperability performance testing | Testing across different vendors' systems |
| **19795-7** | Testing of on-card biometric comparison | For smart card-based biometrics |

## Key Metrics Defined

FAR, FRR, EER, FTA (Failure to Acquire), FTE (Failure to Enroll), FTC (Failure to Capture) — all standardized in ISO 19795.

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - ISO 19795 ensures **biometric performance claims are standardized and comparable**
    - Defines the methodology for measuring FAR, FRR, EER, and other metrics
    - Referenced by NIST FRVT, iBeta, and other testing programs
    - Essential for **vendor evaluation** — performance must be tested per ISO 19795
