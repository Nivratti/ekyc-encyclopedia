## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - USA has **no national digital ID** — CIP relies on document verification or database checks
    - **Method-agnostic**: regulations don't prescribe specific eKYC technology — "reasonable belief" standard
    - **CDD Rule** added beneficial ownership requirements in 2016
    - **FinCEN BOI** (2024) creates federal beneficial ownership registry
    - **50+ state-level driving license formats** make document verification more complex than countries with national ID
