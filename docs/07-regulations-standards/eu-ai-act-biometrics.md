# EU AI Act & Biometrics

## Definition

The **EU AI Act** (2024) is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation. It classifies biometric identification systems as **high-risk**, imposing strict requirements on eKYC AI models.

## Classification for eKYC

| System | AI Act Classification | Requirements |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Remote biometric identification (real-time)** | Prohibited (with exceptions for law enforcement) | Not applicable to eKYC |
| **Remote biometric identification (post)** | High-risk | Conformity assessment, registration, transparency |
| **Face recognition for verification (1:1)** | High-risk | Risk management, data governance, testing, documentation |
| **Face liveness detection** | High-risk (part of biometric system) | Same as above |
| **Document OCR** | Limited/minimal risk | Transparency obligations only |

## High-Risk Requirements

| Requirement | What It Means for eKYC |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Risk management system** | Document and mitigate risks of bias, errors, security vulnerabilities |
| **Data governance** | Training data must be relevant, representative, free from errors |
| **Technical documentation** | Full documentation of model architecture, training, performance |
| **Record-keeping** | Log all verification decisions for audit |
| **Transparency** | Inform users they're interacting with AI, explain decisions |
| **Human oversight** | Ability for human review of AI decisions |
| **Accuracy & robustness** | Meet defined accuracy benchmarks, resilience to adversarial attacks |
| **Bias testing** | Test for and mitigate demographic performance differentials |
| **Conformity assessment** | Third-party assessment before market deployment |

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - EU AI Act classifies eKYC biometric systems as **high-risk** — significant compliance requirements
    - **Bias testing** and **transparency** are mandatory — must test across demographics and explain decisions
    - **Conformity assessment** required before deployment — third-party validation
    - Takes effect **2025-2027** in phases — eKYC providers must prepare now
    - This will become a **global template** — other jurisdictions likely to follow
