# Biometrics Overview

## Definition

**Biometrics** are measurable physical or behavioral characteristics used to identify or verify individuals. In eKYC, biometrics provide the critical link between a person and their claimed identity — proving "you are who you say you are."

## Biometric Modalities

| Modality | Capture Method | Use in eKYC | Prevalence |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Face** | Camera (selfie) | Primary — face matching, liveness | Dominant (95%+ of eKYC) |
| **Fingerprint** | Fingerprint sensor | Aadhaar authentication, in-person eKYC | Common in India, declining globally |
| **Iris** | IR camera | Aadhaar authentication, high-security | Niche |
| **Voice** | Microphone | V-KYC authentication, call center | Emerging |
| **Behavioral** | Device sensors | Continuous authentication, fraud detection | Emerging |

## Why Face Dominates eKYC

| Reason | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Universal capture device** | Every smartphone has a front camera |
| **Non-contact** | No special sensor needed (unlike fingerprint/iris) |
| **Remote-friendly** | Works entirely over internet — no in-person required |
| **Document matching** | ID documents contain face photos — natural comparison point |
| **User familiarity** | Selfies are a natural interaction — low friction |

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - **Face biometrics dominate eKYC** — 95%+ of remote identity verification uses face
    - **Fingerprint** remains important in India (Aadhaar) but is declining for remote eKYC
    - **Voice** and **behavioral** biometrics are emerging for continuous authentication
    - The key challenge is **liveness detection** — proving the biometric comes from a live, present person
