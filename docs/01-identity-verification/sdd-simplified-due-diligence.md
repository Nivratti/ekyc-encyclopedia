# Simplified Due Diligence (SDD)

## Definition

**SDD (Simplified Due Diligence)** is a reduced level of customer due diligence applied to customers assessed as **low-risk**. It allows financial institutions to apply lighter verification measures while still meeting minimum regulatory requirements.

## When SDD is Permitted

| Low-Risk Indicator | Examples |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Customer type** | Government entities, listed companies, regulated financial institutions |
| **Product type** | Low-value prepaid cards (< €150), basic savings with low limits |
| **Geography** | Customer from low-risk, well-regulated jurisdiction |
| **Transaction profile** | Low-value, predictable, domestic transactions |

## SDD vs Standard CDD

| Aspect | SDD | Standard CDD |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Identity verification** | Reduced — may accept fewer documents | Full document + biometric verification |
| **Source of funds** | Not required | May be required |
| **Ongoing monitoring** | Basic | Standard |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Full |
| **Risk assessment** | Pre-determined as low | Individual assessment |

### India-Specific: Small Accounts

RBI allows SDD for "Small Accounts":

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| **Balance** | ≤ ₹50,000 |
| **Annual credits** | ≤ ₹1,00,000 |
| **Monthly withdrawals** | ≤ ₹10,000 |
| **KYC required** | Self-certification + one OVD (no verification needed) |
| **Validity** | 12 months (then full KYC needed to continue) |

## Important Limitations

!!! warning "SDD Does Not Mean No KYC"
    SDD is a **reduced** level — not an exemption. Key rules:
    
    - Customer identity must still be established (though verification may be lighter)
    - SDD is **immediately upgraded to standard CDD or EDD** if suspicion arises
    - SDD cannot be applied if there's any indication of money laundering or terrorist financing
    - The institution must be able to justify why SDD was applied

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - SDD is the **lightest level** of due diligence for demonstrably low-risk customers
    - **Not an exemption** — basic identity must still be established
    - **Immediately escalated** if any suspicious activity is detected
    - In India, SDD enables **Small Accounts** for financial inclusion (₹50K limit)
    - Must be **documented and justified** — regulators will ask why SDD was applied
