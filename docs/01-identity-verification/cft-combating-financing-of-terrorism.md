# Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)

## Definition

**CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism)** refers to the set of laws, regulations, and measures designed to identify, prevent, and disrupt the flow of funds to terrorist organizations and activities. CFT and AML are closely linked — they share the same regulatory frameworks and are often referred to together as **AML/CFT**.

## How Terrorism Financing Differs from Money Laundering

| Aspect | Money Laundering | Terrorism Financing |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Source of funds** | Illegal (proceeds of crime) | Can be legal OR illegal |
| **Amount** | Often large | Often small amounts |
| **Purpose** | Disguise criminal proceeds | Fund terrorist acts |
| **Direction** | Dirty → clean (legitimize) | Clean/dirty → attack funding |
| **Detection** | Follow the money trail | Follow the purpose/recipient |

!!! warning "Critical Difference"
    Terrorism financing is especially hard to detect because the **funds can be entirely legitimate** (donations, salaries, business income) — it's the **intended use** that makes it criminal. Small, seemingly normal transactions can fund devastating attacks.

## CFT in the eKYC Context

| eKYC Component | CFT Application |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Sanctions screening** | Check all customers against OFAC, UN, EU terrorism lists |
| **PEP screening** | Identify individuals connected to state-sponsored terrorism |
| **Geographic risk** | Flag customers from countries with known terrorism financing risks |
| **Transaction monitoring** | Detect small, frequent transfers to high-risk regions |
| **Adverse media** | Flag customers with terrorism-related news |
| **Name screening** | Fuzzy matching against terrorism watchlists |

## Key International CFT Instruments

| Instrument | What It Covers |
|-----------|---------------|
| **FATF Recommendation 5** | Criminalization of terrorist financing |
| **FATF Recommendation 6** | Targeted financial sanctions for terrorism |
| **UN Security Council Resolutions** | 1267 (Al-Qaeda/Taliban), 1373 (all terrorism), 2462 (CFT) |
| **US Executive Orders** | 13224 (blocking terrorist property) |
| **EU Directive 2017/541** | EU terrorism financing directive |

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - CFT is **closely linked to AML** — same frameworks, same eKYC tools, but different detection challenges
    - Terrorism financing can use **legitimate funds** — making detection harder than money laundering
    - **Sanctions screening** is the primary CFT tool in eKYC — checking against UN, OFAC, EU terrorism lists
    - **Small amounts matter** — $10K can fund a terrorist attack, so transaction monitoring thresholds must be low
    - eKYC providers must support real-time, comprehensive sanctions screening as a core capability
