# USA: No National ID Challenge

## Overview

The USA's lack of a national ID creates unique eKYC challenges — 50+ state driving license formats, no central identity database, and reliance on database verification.

## The US Identity Landscape

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **No national ID** | No single authoritative identity document |
| **50+ DL formats** | Each state has different design, security features |
| **SSN is not an ID** | SSN was never designed for identification |
| **No biometric database** | No Aadhaar-equivalent for population-level verification |
| **REAL ID** | Standardizing DL requirements but not a digital ID |

## US eKYC Approaches

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| **DL + selfie + database** | Verify DL document + face match + check against credit bureau/DMV |
| **Passport + selfie** | Passport is most standardized but not universally held |
| **Knowledge-based verification** | Ask personal questions from credit bureau data (declining) |
| **Non-documentary** | Credit bureau, public records, phone/email intelligence |

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - **No national ID** means US eKYC relies heavily on **database verification** (credit bureaus, DMV records)
    - **50+ DL formats** makes document verification technically harder than single-format countries
    - **CIP rule** is method-agnostic — allows documentary OR non-documentary verification
    - US would benefit enormously from digital identity infrastructure like India Stack or EUDI Wallet
