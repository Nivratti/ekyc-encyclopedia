## Mule Types

| Type | Awareness | Recruitment | Detection Difficulty |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Unwitting mule** | Doesn't know they're laundering | "Work from home" job scams | Hard — genuine person, genuine eKYC |
| **Witting mule** | Knows, participates for payment | Direct recruitment, dark web | Medium — behavioral signals |
| **Professional mule** | Experienced, manages multiple accounts | Organized crime | Hard — sophisticated behavior |
| **Synthetic mule** | Fake identity created specifically as mule | Synthetic identity fraud | Very hard — no real person |

## eKYC Relevance

| Signal | What It Indicates |
|--------|-----------------|
| **New account + immediate large transfers** | Mule activity — account opened specifically for laundering |
| **Multiple accounts at different banks** | Same person mule across institutions |
| **Account opened in high-fraud demographics** | Young adults targeted for mule recruitment |
| **Rapid transaction patterns** | Money in-and-out quickly, doesn't match profile |
