## Definition

Understanding the **cost-benefit economics** of fraud prevention — how much fraud costs, how much prevention costs, and how to optimize the investment in eKYC fraud controls.

## Cost of Fraud

| Cost Component | Multiplier | Details |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **Direct loss** | 1x | Money lost to fraud |
| **Investigation** | 1.5-3x | Staff time to investigate each fraud case |
| **Regulatory fines** | Variable (up to billions) | AML failures, data breaches |
| **Reputation damage** | Hard to quantify | Customer trust, brand value |
| **Operational cost** | 1.2-1.5x | System remediation, process changes |

**LexisNexis True Cost of Fraud**: Every $1 of fraud costs the institution **$3.75-$4.23** in total.

## Cost of Prevention

| Component | Cost per Verification | Annual (1M verifications) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **eKYC vendor** | $0.50-5.00 | $500K-$5M |
| **Screening (sanctions/PEP)** | $0.10-0.50 | $100K-$500K |
| **Manual review** | $2-10 per review | $200K-$1M (10% review rate) |
| **Infrastructure** | Variable | $100K-$500K |
| **False rejection cost** | $50-500 lost customer LTV | $500K-$5M |

## ROI Calculation

```
ROI = (Fraud prevented × $4 multiplier - Cost of prevention) / Cost of prevention

Example:
- 1M verifications, 3% fraud attempt rate = 30,000 fraud attempts
- eKYC catches 95% = 28,500 caught, 1,500 slip through
- Average fraud loss: $5,000 per case
- Fraud prevented: 28,500 × $5,000 × $4 = $570M in total cost avoided
- Prevention cost: $3M/year
- ROI: ($570M - $3M) / $3M = 189x
```

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - Every $1 of fraud costs **$3.75-$4.23** when including investigation, fines, and remediation
    - eKYC fraud prevention ROI is typically **50-200x** — one of the highest ROI investments in financial services
    - **False rejection** (turning away legitimate customers) is a real cost — often $50-500 in lost LTV
    - The optimal strategy balances **fraud catch rate** against **false rejection rate** and **prevention cost**
