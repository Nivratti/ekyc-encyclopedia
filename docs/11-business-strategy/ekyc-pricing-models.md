## Pricing Models

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Per-verification** | Fixed price per completed verification | Predictable volume, startups |
| **Tiered volume** | Price decreases at volume thresholds | Growing companies |
| **Subscription + overage** | Monthly fee includes N verifications, pay extra above | Steady volume |
| **Platform fee + per-transaction** | Annual platform fee + per-verification | Enterprise |
| **Component pricing** | Pay per component used (liveness, OCR, screening separately) | Custom builds |

## Typical Price Ranges

| Tier | Volume | Price per Verification |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| **Startup** | < 1,000/month | $2.00-$5.00 |
| **Growth** | 1K-10K/month | $1.00-$3.00 |
| **Scale** | 10K-100K/month | $0.50-$2.00 |
| **Enterprise** | 100K+/month | $0.20-$1.00 |
| **Mega** | 1M+/month | $0.05-$0.50 |
| **Aadhaar eKYC** | Any | $0.04-$0.25 (government subsidized) |
