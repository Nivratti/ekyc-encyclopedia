## Definition

The strategic choice between building/buying a **comprehensive platform** (KYC + fraud + compliance) versus **specialized point solutions** (best-in-class for specific function).

## Comparison

| Aspect | Platform | Point Solution |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Coverage** | Broad (identity + fraud + compliance) | Deep (single capability) |
| **Integration** | Single vendor, unified API | Multiple vendors, integration overhead |
| **Best-of-breed** | Good across everything, great at nothing | Best at one thing |
| **Cost** | Lower total (bundled) | Higher total (multiple vendors) |
| **Vendor lock-in** | Higher | Lower |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to platform capabilities | Mix and match best vendors |

| Examples | Platform: Sumsub, Persona, Alloy | Point: iProov (liveness), Regula (documents), Socure (identity) |
