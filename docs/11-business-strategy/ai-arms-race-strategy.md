# AI Arms Race Strategy

## Definition

Strategies for eKYC providers to stay ahead in the ongoing AI arms race — where attackers use AI (deepfakes, synthetic documents) and defenders must continuously advance their AI defenses.

---

## The Arms Race Dynamic

| Year | Attack Capability | Required Defense |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| **2020** | Basic deepfakes, noticeable artifacts | Standard liveness detection |
| **2022** | Real-time face swap, good voice cloning | Injection prevention, multi-signal |
| **2024** | Near-perfect deepfakes, AI documents | Device attestation, behavioral analytics |
| **2026+** | Full synthetic identity pipeline | Cryptographic provenance, consortium defense |

## Strategic Investments

| Investment | Purpose | Timeline |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Injection prevention** | Block deepfake + virtual camera attacks | Now (critical) |
| **Device attestation** | Prove image from real camera | Now - 2 years |
| **C2PA / content provenance** | Cryptographic proof of image authenticity | 2-5 years |
| **Foundation model fine-tuning** | Leverage large pre-trained models for detection | Now |
| **Continuous model updates** | Monthly retraining as new attacks emerge | Ongoing |
| **Red team / attack simulation** | Internal team that develops new attacks to test defenses | Ongoing |

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - The AI arms race is **the defining challenge** for eKYC in 2025-2030
    - **Injection prevention** (not just liveness) is the critical near-term defense
    - **Cryptographic image provenance (C2PA)** is the long-term solution
    - **Continuous model updates** are essential — a model from 6 months ago may be outdated
    - Having an internal **red team** ensures defenses are tested against latest attacks
