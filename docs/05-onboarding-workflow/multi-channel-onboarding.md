## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Summary"
    - **Mobile app** is optimal but not universal — web and agent channels extend reach
    - **Hybrid flows** (start web → complete mobile) increase flexibility
    - **Agent-assisted** eKYC bridges the gap for users who struggle with technology
    - Each channel needs appropriate **security measures** — web is inherently less secure than native
