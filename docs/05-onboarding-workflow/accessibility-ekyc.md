## Accessibility Challenges

| Group | Challenge | Solutions |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Visually impaired** | Can't see camera guides, quality indicators | Voice guidance, haptic feedback, screen reader support |
| **Motor impairment** | Difficulty holding phone steady, tapping buttons | Extended timeouts, auto-capture, stabilization |
| **Cognitive disability** | Complex instructions confusing | Simple language, fewer steps, visual aids |
| **Elderly** | Small text, unfamiliar technology | Large UI elements, agent-assisted option, V-KYC fallback |
| **Low literacy** | Can't read instructions | Icon-based UI, video instructions, voice guidance |
| **No smartphone** | Can't use mobile eKYC | Agent-assisted, branch-based, USSD-based |
